### Senior Software Engineer

Hi Iâ€™m Pierre, 
a well rounded Full Stack Engineer with 25 years of experience in Software Engineering across multiple industries. I am capable of taking on new assignments and technologies with ease. I easily adapt to new situations, acquire new knowledge quickly and am able to transfer that to others. My strength is to digest complex functional requirements and build a solid and clean codebase. By having been self-employed for over half a decade I understand the need to focus on business value at all times.

My core skills are React, Typescript, Javascript, NodeJS, GraphQL, MongoDB, MySQL and HTML/CSS, however I also have many years of experience with Java and C++ where I started my career. Over the years I have come to grow more towards Frontend WebApp development, which is where I do most of my work now.

I especially enjoy the nature of startups and I am proud to have been part of a number of great companies where I have been able to shine and grow and help them deliver complex software architectures. I am particularly good at grasping complex systems, refactoring and optimizing them and adding core new product features.
